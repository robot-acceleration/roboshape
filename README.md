It's organized as:
* [roboshape-codegen](https://github.com/robot-acceleration/roboshape-codegen): the hardware accelerator generator for the dynamics gradient computation.
* [rbd-accelerator-harness](https://github.com/robot-acceleration/rbd-accelerator-harness): the test harness for building and running the generated accelerator.
